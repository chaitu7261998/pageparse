Page Parsing for codeforces to check test cases

Enter contest code as input Eg: 510A
The code file should be in the same directory as the program.
The code should be in cpp and should be named as the contest code Eg: 510A.cpp
PASSED! - Test passed
FAILED! - Test failed



Due to some bad coding the contest code should be of 4 characters (1A or 49C are not valid)
